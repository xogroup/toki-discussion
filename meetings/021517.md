# Toki Weekly Agenda for 02/15/17

## What We Did

### OSS Tooling
+ Linting
    + Using hapi's lint style with eslint, lab configured for linting as part of testing
    + Please still keep an .eslintrc so that IDEs show linting as you write code!
+ Testing
    + Using hapi's lab/code modules
    + Please use the BDD style (describe/it), see the oss generator for a sample
+ Generator
    + There is now an 'oss' generator in `generator-local`
+ Documentation Standards for each project
    + README.md - Brief overview
    + API.md - Full API docs
    + Example.md - Some basic examples for common patterns
    + Examples of the above are also in the generator, with comments for formatting and a list of needed badges

    + CONTRIBUTING.md (/.github of every repo? Possibly linked?)

This tooling will continue to evolve. It's important that as it continues to evolve we communicate and update existing toki-* projects. Currently our source of truth for this is the oss generator.

### Progress

+ `toki-logger` - Done
+ `toki-hapi-bridge` - Done, Will likely continue to evolve
+ `bunnybus` - Done
+ `toki-config` - Done
+ `toki-config-file` - Done
+ `toki-core` - Done minus docs and dependencies

## What we're doing

+ Toki Logo - Rob
+ Experimental builds and initial integrations - Derrick on initial integration
    + Necessary to determine a release timeline
    + Currently underway, quick progress
+ `toki-method-http` - Up for grabs
    + Create/Assemble Config, Mapping Req/Res?
+ `toki-method-rabbit` - Up for grabs
    + Create/Assemble Config, Mapping Req/Res?
+ (Unnamed) toki rules templating engine
    + Initial research and underlying engine choice - Lam
        + dotjs
    + Implement into Toki core itself - Up for grabs
+ Several configs for flows (RFQ, Inquiry) - Up for grabs (Delay?)

## Open Concerns

+ Where do we keep documentation for OSS related tooling and patterns?
+ How do we handle singletons? Can we depend on module caching or do we need a better strategy? (Wrapper, passing instances)
    + Depend on module cache, document
+ Capturing open tasks re OSS
    + Issues
    + TODO.md

## Open floor

Can we release toki/chronos in pieces?
    + Possibly if we don't emit rabbit events, but there may be side effects
    + Further investigation needed
    + `toki-method-proxy`?

Toki things that are still in Git Enterprise:
    + Clean up old repos (Delete if not needed, archive if useful)


+ Current Blockers
+ Current Concerns
+ Other Questions
